            <p>Oakland International Airport (OAK) is the closest airport. It's about a 20 minute drive or BART ride from the Kissel hotel and wedding venue. San Francisco International Airport (SFO) is also a good option. It's about a 45 minute drive or BART ride from the Kissel hotel and wedding venue.</p>
